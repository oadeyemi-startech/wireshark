# Wireshark Protocol Analyzer
### Objective
The main objective of this activity is to use the Wireshark protocol analyzer to capture and analyze network data.

### Skills Learned
- Installation and setup of network analysis software (Wireshark).
- Network Packet Capture using Wireshark on a selected network interface (WiFi).
- Filtering captured network traffic to view specific protocols (e.g., ICMP).
- Using the command line utility "ipconfig" to determine a computer's network configuration (IPv4 Address, Subnet Mask, Default Gateway).
- Performing a "ping sweep" to discover active hosts on a local area network (LAN).
- Analyzing captured packets in Wireshark to locate and record source and destination IP/MAC addresses for local hosts.
- Executing ping commands to remote websites and observing the resulting traffic in Wireshark.
- Using the command line utility "arp -a" to view the ARP cache.
- Understanding the difference between local (LAN) and remote (Internet) destination MAC addresses in captured traffic, specifically noting that the remote website's MAC address is replaced by the default gateway's MAC address (or the next hop's) in the local frame.

### Tools Used
- Windows Destop (running Window OS 11)
- Wireshark protocol analyzer (This software is described as a "packet sniffer" used for network diagnostic and analysis)
- CLI "Command Prompt" (on Windows) to run commands like ipconfig, ping, and arp -a

### Wireshark packet capture and analysis of local host and remote website traffic.
